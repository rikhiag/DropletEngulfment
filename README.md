# Different pathways for engulfment and endocytosis of liquid droplets by nanovesicles
This is the repository of example input [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) scripts to set up Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations from the manuscript "Different pathways for engulfment and endocytosis of liquid droplets by nanovesicles". 
The first step is to install the MD simulator [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), which is an open-source computational package for MD simulation (installation instructions given in the website). We have used the version [lammps-7Aug19](https://download.lammps.org/tars/). In order to assemble the initial configuration of each set of vesicle, we used [PACKMOL](http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/examples.shtml). 
With the input LAMMPS scripts given here and using the information given in the Method section of the manuscript, one can reproduce all the simulations described in the work. 
We are happy to answer any questions and comments by email (rikhia.ghosh2002@gmail.com, Reinhard.Lipowsky@mpikg.mpg.de).
