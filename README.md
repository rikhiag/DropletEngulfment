# Different pathways for engulfment and endocytosis of liquid droplets by nanovesicles
This is the repository of example input scripts to set up Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations detailed in the manuscript "Different pathways for engulfment and endocytosis of liquid droplets by nanovesicles"
The first step is to set up the MD simulator Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator ([LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0)), which is an open-source computational package for MD simulation. We have been using the version [lammps-7Aug19](https://download.lammps.org/tars/), on which our custom modifications were built.
